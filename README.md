## What is this

This is my new dotfiles that I will use in the next few years or might be my last dotfiles repo, this repo is not only for NixOS, but also for Android, and maybe hopefully servers and Macs if i have money.

I use combination of chezmoi for dealing with sensitive files that need to be kept secret, and Home-manager for managing my home configuration.

This repo is intended to combine my existing setup but also new Nix paradigm, not only to not shackled so much with Nix, but enables me to use some of my configurations on random Servers or PC that might be thrown at me to be worked on.

## Screenshots

## File Structure

This is how I structure my nix-configs currently, it might will have few more directories, maybe regarding theming, users, or something else in the future.

the naming scheme is auto generated by Chezmoi, so don't be surprised.

on the front you will have:

- `dot_scripts`, my scripts which mostly bash scripts, carry over from my old dotfiles.
- `mutable-configs`, configs that is mutable, not worth it to be carried to home directory since it will changed a lot, will be symlinked by the home-manager depend on what i need.
- `private_dot_nix-configs`, my actual nix configs.
- `private_dot_secrets`, well...encrypted files, configs, secrets
- `private_dot_ssh`, obviously...my ssh key
- `Templates`, templates of files...maybe not a lot that I added atm.
- `Wallpapers`, Waifu and car picture for Wallpapersa

then when it comes to my actual `.nix-configs`, the directories looks like this.

- `aliases`, my aliases...also carried from my old dotfiles.
- `configs`, mostly my configuration files of packages, tried not to use nix for this so I can use it on non Nix systems.
- `desktop`, my systems configs
- `droids`, configurations for `Nix On Droid`, Nix but for Android
- `home`, my home-manager configs, tried to seperate from systems as much as possible
- `machines`, mostly for backups but it's collection of hardware-configurations.
- `modules`, modules of nix codes, seperated by systems and home-manager ofc.
- `theming`, modules for my ricing.
- users, modules for users, if there's more than me.

This thing obviously can change overtime as this dotfiles grow.

## Installation

ofc, i will assumed you to have nix installed with it's channel exist

run this command to get my dotfiles:

```nix
nix-shell -p chezmoi git --run "chezmoi init dhupee"
```

then you add my Age key to the home directory, if you don't know, rob me. After that you run:

```nix
chezmoi apply
```

This will decrypt encypted files, and send the directories to targeted place, then `switch` your NixOS and Home-Manager, in `.nix-configs` directory run this:

```nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nitro
home-manager switch --flake .#dhupee
```

that will rebuild the systems and bring every tooling and ricing I have.

## To-Do List

- [x] ~~Neovim modules with nixvim, finished then migrate fully~~ Managed use most of my old configs with something left behind for now
- [ ] Vscode modules also
- [x] Migrating few of my scripts from old dotfiles
- [ ] Theming related, KDE, Gnome, Hyprland whatever i can just change since its Nix
- [ ] Make a command and control like for managing nix, built in go, name Yuki
- [ ] Either specific nix for centralized configuration, or maybe on the flake
- [x] Utilizing rootless Nix
